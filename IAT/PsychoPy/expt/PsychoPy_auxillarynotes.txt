Code in 'SetupCode'
===================

#Order is specified by experimenter at start of experiment via dialogue box
order=int(expInfo['order']) #convert to integer

#Now counterbalance pro-stereotype vs anti-stereotype IAT blocks

#Default is pro-stereotypical - "Congruent" first
trainfiles=['cong_train.xlsx','incong_train.xlsx']
testfiles=['cong_test.xlsx','incong_test.xlsx']
trainlabelsL=['A = \nWhite','A = \nBlack']
trainlabelsR=['L = \nBlack','L = \nWhite']
testlabelsL=['A = \nWhite or \nPositive','A = \nBlack or \nPositive']
testlabelsR=['L = \nBlack or \nNegative','L = \nWhite or \nNegative']

In Superloop_code
==========================================

#Set stimuli files and labels according to this is the 1st or 2nd time we are here
testblockfile=testfiles[superloop.thisRepN]
trainblockfile=trainfiles[superloop.thisRepN]
trainlabelL=trainlabelsL[superloop.thisRepN]
trainlabelR=trainlabelsR[superloop.thisRepN]
testlabelL=testlabelsL[superloop.thisRepN]
testlabelR=testlabelsR[superloop.thisRepN]


A note on the stimuli
======================

In train and test the image sizes are different

Stimuli are indexed by the .xlxs files and the line in the appropriate block, something like this

os.path.join('stimuli',$StimuliImages)

This tells PsychoPy to look in the subdirectory 'stimuli' for the files with the names specified in $SimuliImages

Issues
======

The ready blocks show the wrong labels

The 2nd block of superloop is currently mis-labelled, it should be "test_block" not "non_congruent"

    trainlabelL="A = White"
    trainabelR="L = Black"
    testlabelL="A = White or Positive"
    testlabelR="L = Black or Negative"
